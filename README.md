# Oracle book

The idea of this repo is to have a collection of useful examples, expanding on what the Oracle documentation provides.

This was motivated by a recent Slideshare I saw, about using newer features of the database. It was more specific to PostgreSQL, but it made me realise, I could probably do with learning some of the more modern features of Oracle database. Since the company I work for still largely uses 11gR2, I will be focusing on that for now.

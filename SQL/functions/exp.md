# EXP

`exp` raises Euler's number (e) to the power of n (the passed in parameter)


```sql
select exp(1), exp(2)
from dual
```
Output:
```
    EXP(1)     EXP(2)
---------- ----------
2.71828183  7.3890561

```

### Background

If you're wondering what Euler's number is - as I was - I suggest having a look at the following resources:

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)
* http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.e.html
* http://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/e-eulers-number.html

Without going into the full history, some common problems the Eueler's number is used in are:

* Compounding interest calculations
* The bell curve
* Problems involving probability
* Calculus
